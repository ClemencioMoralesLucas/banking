# Banking Kata
A TDD (Test Driven Development) kata with a 100% unit test coverage consisting on a set of classes and unit tests for savings accounts and checking accounts:

Consider two different types of bank accounts â€“ savings accounts and checking accounts. Each account has an owner and a balance.
Accounts also support deposits and withdrawals of money amounts.

A savings account additionally supports interest payments to its owner based on a certain interest rate
tied to the account. There should be a possibility to calculate and pay the appropriate interest to a
savings account.

A checking account additionally supports balance overdrafts restricted by a limit tied to the account.
There should be a possibility to do cash transfers between checking accounts
